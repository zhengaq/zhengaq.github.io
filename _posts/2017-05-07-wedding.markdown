On May 7th, 2017, the happiest day in my life so far, we held our wedding at my hometown, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China. That's a long day. The first part of our wedding in the morning session follows Chinese traditions. After lunch, we went to a park and got some beautiful pictures and videos. At the dinner time, we invited many friends join us to celebrate. Here is a [short video](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjc1MDI5ODY1Mg==.html?from=s1.8-1-1.2&spm=a2h0k.8191407.0.0) for everything before the dinner.
