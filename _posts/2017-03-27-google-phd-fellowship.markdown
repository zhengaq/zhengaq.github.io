I'm honored to receive the Google Ph.D. Fellowship from Fall 2017. The full list of 2017 Google Ph.D. Fellow can be found [here](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/announcing-2017-google-phd-fellows-for.html). There are 33 recipients from North America, Europe and the Middle East. I'm the sole winner in Structured Data and Database Management from North America.

In May, the Grad College at UIUC reported my wining of 2017 Google PhD Fellowship: [Two Illinois Graduate Students Win Google Fellowship](http://www.grad.illinois.edu/news/two-illinois-graduate-students-win-google-fellowship).
