Recently, we have gradually developed many theoretically sound and practically useful named entity recognition (NER) tools.

**Check Our New NER ToolkitðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**
- **Inference**:
  - **[LightNER](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/LightNER)**: inference w. models pre-trained / trained w. *any* following tools, *efficiently*. 
- **Training**:
  - **[LD-Net](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/LD-Net)**: train NER models w. efficient contextualized representations.
  - **[VanillaNER](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Vanilla_NER)**: train vanilla NER models w. pre-trained embedding.
- **Distant Training**:
  - **[AutoNER](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/AutoNER/)**: train NER models w.o. line-by-line annotations and get competitive performance.
