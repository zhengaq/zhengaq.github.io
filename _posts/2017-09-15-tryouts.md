# Details

This year, I am the UIUC ICPC Team's coach. Our coach team has created the problem set for the first tryout on Sept 23, and the second tryout will be the North America Online Qualifier Contest 2017 on Oct 7. Top performed students will be sent to ACM/ICPC North America Mid-Central Regionals at Chicago in November. If your team placed in top 2 (sometimes 3, like last year) in the regional contest, we will bring you to Beijing, China for the World Finals in April!

Meanwhile, I’ve created a practice contest on vjudge on Saturday from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM. That’s the last year’s second Tryout. And the problem set of the last year’s first Tryout is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7u3650lzlpnpirw/uiuc_2016_tryout_1.pdf?dl=1). If you are new, remember to read through it and get some sense about our Tryouts.
