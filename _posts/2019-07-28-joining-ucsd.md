I'm joining UC San Diego as Assistant Professor starting from Jan 2020. I will be jointly appointed by [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) and [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/). I'm looking for talented & dedicated students to work together on data-driven, large-scale text mining and network mining problems.
