# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/)'s [Data Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) at [CS@Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/), and a [Google PhD Fellow](https://ai.google/research/outreach/phd-fellowship). I received my B.E. from Computer Science Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ. (SJTU), China, where I was a member of the 2010 [ACM Honored class](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/), now part of Zhiyuan College in SJTU. 

My research focuses on developing principled *data-driven* approaches, with *little human curation and labeling*, to transform unstructured text data into structured heterogeneous information networks, on which actionable knowledge can be further uncovered flexibly and effectively based on user's instructions.

My research has been recognized by many prestigious awards, including Computer Science Excellence Scholarship from CS@Illinois, Grand Prize of Yelp Dataset Challenge in 2015, Google PhD Fellowship in Structured Data and Database Management in 2017, and C.W. Gear Outstanding Graduate Award in 2018.

In addition, I love competitive programming contests, such as ACM/ICPC, Topcoder Open, Google Codejam, Facebook Hackercup, etc. I'm now the coach of the UIUC's ACM/ICPC team and I enjoy mentoring and coaching students.
