If you are also a Synology user, this platform is much better than Drive 2.0; use Time Machine to backup only system files and applications, with the speed-up setting as below (use the SMB protocol instead of the AFP protocol for Synology).  Even only a small portion of my files (~100 Gb) is handled by Time Machine, they could be a very slow 100 Gb without speeding up. The reason is the system sets an upper bound on the performance of Time Machine by default.

Some students pursue learning for learning sake (i.e. mastery goal orientation), some are driven by gaining favourable judgement of their performance (i.e. performance approach goal orientation), and others focus on avoiding negative judgement (i.e. performance avoidance goal orientation). These goal orientations are linked with academic achievement, and troublingly, students report decreasing levels of goal orientations across the school years. However, little is known concerning the mechanisms that drive this decline. In a large (N = 891 twin pairs) cross‐sectional genetically informative sample (age = 8 to 22 years), we found that older students reported lower goal orientations. Then, we identified shifts in the magnitude of genetic and environmental variance in each goal orientation. For example, variance in mastery goal orientation was primarily associated with environmental factors during the elementary school years. As students entered high school, genetic influences increased, replacing shared environmental influences. Finally, we situated these findings in the larger nomological network by testing associations with psychological constructs (e.g. personality and cognitive ability) and contextual variables (e.g. parents, schools, and peers). The development of academic motivation is complex with many interconnecting factors that appear to shift with age.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic and environmental influences on achievement goal orientations shift with age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["René Mõttus","Daniel A.

In more economically prosperous families, schools, and nations, student interest was more strongly correlated with actual knowledge. Here, we investigated whether these results still held despite substantial changes to educational and economic systems over roughly a decade. Using similar data from PISA 2015 (N = 537,170), we found largely consistent results. Students from more economically advantaged homes, schools, and nations exhibited a stronger link between interests and knowledge. However, these moderation effects were substantially reduced, and the main effect of science interest increased by nearly 25%, driven almost entirely by families of low socioeconomic status and nations with low gross domestic product. The interdependence of interests and resources is robust but perhaps weakening with educational progress.","tags":null,"title":"National gross domestic product, science interest, and science achievement: A direct replication and extension of the Tucker-Drob, Cheung, and Briley (2014) study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusuke Takahashi","Anqing Zheng","Shinji Yamagata","Juko Ando"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-30010694400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-30010694400,"objectID":"cf1f2d7b774e40669a8ce09032629834","permalink":"https://zhengaq.github.io/publication/takahashi-grit-2020/","publishdate":"1020-03-08T02:34:11.666272Z","relpermalink":"/publication/takahashi-grit-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Using a genetically informative design (about 2,000 twin pairs), we investigated the phenotypic and aetiological architecture of a broad construct of conscientiousness (including conscientiousness per se, effortful control, self-control, and grit). These four distinct measures were substantially correlated; the coefficients ranged from 0.74 (0.72–0.76) to 0.79 (0.76–0.80). Univariate genetic analyses revealed that individual differences in conscientiousness measures were mostly attributable to additive genetic factors, to an extent ranging from 62% (58–65%) to 64% (61–67%); we obtained no evidence that shared environmental factors were in play. Multivariate genetic analyses showed that the four measures used to assess conscientiousness were more genetically correlated, and that a common genetic factor accounted for over 84% of the genetic variance. Our findings suggest that individual differences in the four measures of conscientiousness are distinguishable at both the phenotypic and aetiological levels, and that the overlap was substantially attributable to genetic factors that might affect only a single set of genes.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic and environmental architecture of Conscientiousness in adolescence: Grit is aetiologically a facet of Conscientiousness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anqing Zheng","Daniel A.
